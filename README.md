# Description
This repo contains the supporting documents and files necessary for the shiny app developed for the Developing Data products course.  No data is required for this app. You only need to input in 2 dates (one your birthday and the other today's current date). 
The script written for this app will calculate your birthday in days. Once the dates are entered hit submit and get your results.

Note: Even though R has a inbuilt method for calculating this, working through the code myself was great practice for novice programmer like myself.
